# Flappy Bird Python
 Flappy Bird coded in Python using pygame

Fully functioning flappy bird game coded entirely in python. Uses images provided in the sprite class to give it the original look but can be modified to change the background, ground, pipes, and bird into different sprites.

Utilizes multiple classes in order to implement functions to the ground, pipes, bird, score and reset. The ground and pipe class are scrolling to create a movement effect. The score keeps track of how many pipes the bird has crossed. The bird switches sprites to make it seem like the wings are flapping and rotates along with its movement.

The game begins when the user clicks their mouse and the user should click their mouse contnously in order to make the bird jump. A score is displayed at the top and a restart button is provided so user can restart after the bird collides with something.
